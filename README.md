### _Check if a person exists on the database or create a new one._

This application provides a web page with a form for the user
to query or insert new data into the database. The form contains
the input fields "name", which is unique and cannot be repeated,
and "age", which doesn't mind being duplicated.

## Tech

-   React.js and Sass (mostly Flexbox) for the front-end
-   Client-side requests with Node's fetch() API
-   MongoDB with Mongoose for data storage
-   Express.js for the back-end
